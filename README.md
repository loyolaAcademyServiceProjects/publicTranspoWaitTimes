# publicTranspoWaitTimes
This is LA's first coding service project. It aims to come up with a system to display the wait times of relevant avenues of public transportation for students on the TV screen in the front lobby of LA from 2:00pm-3:30pm every week day.

Prerequisites:

must have at least `python3.7` or higher and the same verison chrome driver and chrome application.  I recommend chrome 108 since 109 isn't stable.


install all libraries needed:
```
bash ./preReq.sh
```
